Analyzed COVID-19 Trends and Built Predictive Models to Generate Actionable Solutions 
Covid-19 Analysis & Prediction
## Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts the spread of Covid-19 cases using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The notebook performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to understand trends and forecast future cases.

## Objectives

Perform EDA to understand the global and regional spread of Covid-19.

Visualize trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

Build predictive models for case forecasting.

Derive insights to support policy-making and healthcare planning.

## Dataset

Source: Public Covid-19 datasets (e.g., Johns Hopkins University, Kaggle).

Features (common examples):

Date

Country/Region

Confirmed Cases

Recovered Cases

Deaths

## Tech Stack

Programming: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models

Statsmodels / Prophet – Time Series forecasting 

## Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Converting dates to datetime format.

Aggregating case counts by country/region.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Global spread visualization.

Country-level case trends.

Growth patterns of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

Prediction Models

Applied ML/Time-series models to forecast future cases.

Models compared: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or ARIMA/Prophet.

Evaluation

Used metrics like RMSE, MAE, R² to validate models.

## Key Insights

Covid-19 spread showed exponential growth in the early phases.

Some countries flattened the curve earlier due to strict lockdowns.

Predictive models provide short-term forecasts for confirmed cases.

## Results

Generated visual insights into global and country-specific Covid-19 cases.

Built forecasting models that can help policymakers in planning.

Ensemble and time-series methods outperformed simple regression models.
